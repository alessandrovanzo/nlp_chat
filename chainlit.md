# Welcome to RAG Chat!

Hi there! I'm your AI assistant with access to a knowledge base. I can search for information and answer your questions using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

## Upload PDFs

Want to add your own documents to the knowledge base?

**[Click here to upload PDFs](http://localhost:8001/upload)**

Upload your PDF documents with custom chunking and metadata. They'll be embedded using OpenAI and immediately searchable!

## How to Use

Just ask me questions! I'll automatically search the knowledge base when needed and provide informed answers with sources.

**Try asking:**
- "What documents do you have?"
- "Tell me about [topic from your PDFs]"
- "Search for [keyword]"
